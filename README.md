This is a website that uses Canvas to draw fractals inspired by Sutcliffe Pentagons. I first heard about these shapes in the book Generative Art [TODO: add link].

## Features:
- Draws Fractal shapes
- Button to pause/start
- Button to Download the image

## Future Features:
- Host on Github pages
- Add more buttons for increased customizability
- Format website layout
